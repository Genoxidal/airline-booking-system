3. Introduction
This document outlines the technical specifications for the "[Your Project Name Here]" project. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the system's design, functionality, and requirements to guide development and ensure all stakeholders are aligned.

4. Overall Description
[Provide a high-level overview of the system. What is its purpose? Who are the target users? What problem does it solve?]

5. Visual Mockup Reference
[Include links or references to any visual mockups, wireframes, or design prototypes. If you have an image, you can embed it here or link to it.]

6. Features
[List the key features of the application. For example:]

User authentication (signup, login, logout)

Data entry and management

Reporting and analytics

[Specific feature related to your project, e.g., "Calculate total order amount"]

7. Functional Requirements
[Detail the specific functions the system must perform. Use a clear, unambiguous format. For example:]

FR-001: The system shall allow users to input an array of numerical values.

FR-002: The system shall calculate the sum of the numerical values in the input array.

FR-003: The system shall return undefined if the input is not an array.

FR-004: The system shall display the calculated total order amount to the user, formatted to two decimal places.

FR-005: The system shall provide an error message if the input is not a valid JSON array.

8. Non-Functional Requirements
[Specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. For example:]

Performance: The system shall calculate the total for an array of 1000 items within 1 second.

Usability: The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for new users.

Security: User data shall be protected through industry-standard encryption.

Scalability: The system shall be able to handle up to 100 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.

9. Data Requirements
[Describe the data that will be stored, processed, and managed by the system. This might include data models, data types, and relationships.]

Order Item: Number (decimal, e.g., 10.50)

Order Array: Array of Numbers

10. External Interface Requirements
[Detail any interfaces the system will have with external systems, APIs, or hardware.]

None (for the current order calculator example)

11. Glossary
JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format.

Array: A data structure that stores a collection of elements.

Undefined: A primitive value in JavaScript indicating that a variable has not been assigned a value.

12. Appendices
[Any supplementary information, diagrams, or additional resources.]
